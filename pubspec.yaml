description: A new Flutter application.

# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number used as CFBundleVersion.
# Read more about iOS versioning at
# https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CoreFoundationKeys.html

# flutter_ijkplayer (as of v0.3.5+1, backed by IJKPlayer & ffmpeg):
# - support content URIs (`DataSource.photoManagerUrl` from v0.3.6, but need fork to support content URIs on Android <Q)
# - does not support AC3 (by default, but possible by custom build)
# - can play if only the video or audio stream is supported
