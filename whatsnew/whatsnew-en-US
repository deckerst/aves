Thanks for using Aves!
In v1.5.6:
- fixed video playback ignoring hardware-accelerated codecs on recent devices
- partially fixed deleted files leaving ghost items on some devices
- you can now create shortcuts to a specific media item, not only collections
In v1.5.5:
- modify items in bulk (rotation, date, metadata removal)
- filter items by title
- enjoy the app in Russian
Note: the video thumbnails are modified. Clearing the app cache may be necessary.
